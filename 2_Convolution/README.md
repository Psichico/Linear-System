## All Codes for Covolution of two Signals

1. Rect_Function_FFT.m
   Code generates two custom rectangular function using step inputs.
   After the convolution of both the rectangular signals, FFT has been performed.
   
2. Convolution_of_signals_with_slope_equation.m  
   x1 = -3t + 15 ;
   x2 = t^2      ;
